Storing information in object properties was one of the easiest  
things I've done in a lab so far.  
Calculating and storing simulated amounts of cookies purchased for each hour at each location using average cookies purchased and the random number of customers generated was  
definitely not.  
Math.random is a weird thing... Inclusive? Exclusive? Both? I understand it a little  
better now that it's been more clearly explained.
