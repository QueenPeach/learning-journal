Building tables in JavaScript is quite a process!!!  
tableEl, tbodyEL, trEl, tdEl, ELELELELELELELELELELELE.  
Constructors really cut down on how much code you need to use and  
makes it much easier to read.  
Figuring out this whole DOM tree thing is confusing.  
Parents and children and nodes and appending...
