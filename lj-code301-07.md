Yesterday we set up our client and server sides through GitHub and Heroku.  
Today we actually used psql to create our database and tables for  
our book app, which was pretty cool. Once you go through the motions a few  
times addding columns it's actually pretty easy. I'm really glad I'm using a  
Mac so my psql is all intergrated with my terminal.
