The first two days of class I felt like I had somewhat of a grasp on what was going on,
but today I'm having trouble with this whole 'for' and 'while' loop thing.
Variables and ++ and numbers and === and counters???
Definitely the hardest day so far,
so I'm kind of worried for what's going to come next.
I hope I can start understanding these concepts.
