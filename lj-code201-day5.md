Thank god it's the weekend!  
Pair programming was a really helpful thing.  
My partner helped explain some things I was confused on  
and really showed me the proper way to write clean javascript code.  
I am a little nervous for Monday, as next week is supposed to be the hardest.  
I'm still having trouble grasping some things,  
so I think on Monday I am going to have to ask for help.
