Having lecture at the end of the day is awful!!! I'm having such a hard time  
focusing. Today we are learned about jQuery events and using the $.on() method,  
and comprehending when event delegation is appropriate. Today's lab went pretty  
we finished with some time before we needed to go to lecture. I can only hope  
that tomorrows will go that smoothly.
